# DFCAN-pytorch

DFCAN/DFGAN could get an amazing result in SIM  super resolution reconstruction  in optical microscopy. 

Code is basically a pytorch implementation of DFCAN/DFGAN(https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-020-01048-5).  

All credit goes to the authors of DFCAN/DFGAN, listed in the paper“Evaluation and development of deep neural networks for image super-resolution in optical microscopy”.

This realized vesion is without the process of prctile_norm and recovery.
